# Project Flux - Architecture Description

This project started as a very ambitious DevDay talk, and as such is full of cool ideas that will not necessarily be useful.

The initial driver was that I wanted to do a talk about creating useful business software (This got a few groans - my previous talk had been about sci-fi user interfaces) utilising interesting new interface technology (Restoring some hope).

So with that in mind, parts of this system will be somewhat over-engineered, not necessarily useful, or purely done because we found it interesting.

## Introduction

As software developers, we are always looking for new tools or processes to make our lives easier. This has led to Agile processes and Agile tools. Which unfortunately are often not very agile.

So as software engineers, we know that the solution is to build more tools (Or create new processes)...

The idea is to build tools that take our existing tools and processes and improve them in interesting (and quite possibly useless) ways.

## Goals
There are two overarching goals that has driven most of the decisions:

* Having as much fun as possible
* Learning as much as possible

From a system perspective, our goals include:

* An easy way to print out JIRA tickets to use on a physical board.
* A mobile app that make JIRA easier to use in an agile team.
* An augmented view of a physical task board.
* An automated way to keep JIRA in sync with our physical board.

## Assumptions

* Nobody wants another issue tracker, so it makes sense to integrate with an existing one.

## Philosophy

As this is a pet project being developed for the learning experience, some 'bad' decisions will be made in the design and requirements and this is perfectly fine.

The overarching goals here is to create something cool to show off, learn new stuff and have fun doing it.

Having said all this, bad code is unacceptable. 

## Significant Requirements

* Print out coded tickets that can be recognised by the different systems.
* Connect to JIRA and display sprint details from a mobile app.
* Update ticket details on JIRA from a mobile app.
* Scan tickets from a mobile app.
* Identify and ID tickets on a realtime video feed.
* Recognise and id tickets from an image on sync app.

## Constraints

* As this is a pet project, time will be extremely constrained. 
* Must use JIRA as a issue tracker as the team has experience with JIRA and atlassian provides open source licenses.
* Must have a service layer allowing us to communicate with JIRA (and probably other API's)
* Mobile app will be developed on Android as the whole team is familiar with it and owns Android phones.
* The system needs to run on cheap hardware as each project/physical board will likely run it's own system and we have a small budget.

## Architecture Style and Refinements

The system will use a *shared repository* architecture since it will use JIRA as a data store.

The individual component systems will also use a *layered* and *tiered* architecture to aid in maintainability of the system and allow users to host different components of the system on different hardware.

## Team Overview

* **Riaan Cornelius** (Team Lead)
* **Elsab√© Ros**
* **Martin Naude** (Business Owner)
* **Rishal Hurbens** (Tech Lead)

As this project was conceived as an Entelect DevDay talk, The work done for the talk can be treated as an architectural spike.

Most of the architectural decisions, requirements and constraints were uncovered during this architectural spike.

As Martin and Rishal only joined the team once this was rebranded as a Tech Accelerator project, their roles will be very limited.
